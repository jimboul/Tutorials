Time Series Analysis - Handbook: A detailed handbook/tutorial is presented in this folder and the relevant notebook on how we should work with Time Series data. The purpose of all developed models is educational and not to outperform any current benchmark and thus, a randomly-generated time series dataset has been used

NASA_Asteroid_Classification: This folder contains a XGBoost model used for predicting whether a planet(-oid) is an asteroid or not. The model is trained on a NASA's dataset.

Exoplanet Detection: This folder contains a notebook in which two models - a XGBoost and a neural network - have been developed to detect whether a star has at least one exoplanet in orbit or not. The model is trained on time series data gathered from NASA Kepler space telescope which measured the change in flux (light intensity) of thousands of stars at several time steps.
